# Capstone Project: Maze Game


## Instructions:
1. Download a local copy of the code. | [How to](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. Open the project and use the following CLI commands inside the Terminal:
* **python3 -m venv venv** (Creates a virtual environment).
* **source venv/bin/activate** (Activates the virtual environment).
* **pip install -r requirements.txt** (Installs dependencies).
3. Run the application and follow the prompts.

## Learning Objectives:

|Learning Objective|How it was accomplished|
|------------------|-----------------------|
|Learn New Algorithms| Used Randomized DFS algorithm to generate the maze. Used backtracking to generate solution path.|
|Learn Gaming|Used PyGame to: create game stages and backgrounds. create, display and move sprites. create Levels.|
|Apply Object Oriented Design Concepts|Created classes such as Cell (representing each cell inside a maze), Player (inherits from the built-in Sprite class), MazeGenerator (to create/display mazes), GameState (to call different functions based on game states) and the main class.|
